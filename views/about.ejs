      My name is Pulkit Gupta. I am a 2nd-year student of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
      Technical University (India). My area of expertise is Web development and
      Web Testing. I've previously worked on MERN stack-based projects. I've
      also tried my hand at freelancing. I am a hard-working individual, honest
      and dedicated to my work, and always keen to acquire new skills. My flaw
      is that I may become diffident at times. However, I am addressing my
      shortcoming now by actively participating with open source communities.

    <strong>Development Background:</strong>
    <p class="about-para">
      C++ was my first programming language while I was in 11th grade, I have
      also won some programming certificates in C++. I began learning front-end
      development in my first year of college, and this is where my adventure
      with open source began. I have previously worked on a few modest open
      source projects. I've also dabbled with Nodejs backend coding and created
      some web apps. I have a fair bit of familiarity with standard data
      structures and algorithms, in C and C++ (for the purpose of competitive
      programming and learning). I can write, explain and even teach to code in
      a variety of languages, including Javascript, Typescript, Python, and C++.
